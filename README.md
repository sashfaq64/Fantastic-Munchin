# Fantastic-Munchin

Fantastic Munchin is a dummy website that replicates the site of a restaurant. The user is able to select items from a wide variety of items. Backend support, using SQLite, records the number of interactions. Finally, a tip-calculator is available when a user inputs their total bill.

This project is not functional at the moment as the prior host of the database is not working. Please take a look at the code and message me with any and all questions!
